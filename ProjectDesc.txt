Objective
• Provide the best performing model to determine probability for a patient 
having a heart disease or attack.
• Providing the most important drivers for a heart disease or attack

Data Description
The data provided consists of the following Data Dictionary

• HeartDiseaseorAttack: Target variable determining whether patient had prior
heart disease or heart attack.
• HighBP: Binary flag determining whether a patient has high blood pressure.
• HighChol: Binary flag determining whether a patient has high cholesterol levels.
• BMI: Numeric value representing the Body Mass Index.
• Smoker: Binary flag determining whether a patient smokes or not.
• Diabetes: Binary flag determining whether a patient has diabetes or not.
• Fruits: Binary flag determining whether a patient consumes fruits in daily diet
or not.
• Veggies : Binary flag determining whether a patient consumes vegetables in
daily diet or not.
• HvyAlcoholConsump: Binary flag determining whether a patient is a heavy
consumer of alcohol.
• MentHlth: Numeric value representing mental fitness, ranging from 0 to 30.
• PhysHlth: Numeric value representing physical fitness, ranging from 0 to 30
• Sex: Determining gender of the patient
• Age: The age of the patient binned into buckets between 1-13
• Education: The education level of the patient binned into buckets between 1-6.
• Income: The income of the patient binned into buckets between 1-8

Steps and Tasks
● Import libraries and load dataset
● Exploratory Data Analysis :
○ Including univariate analysis to understand the distribution of features.
○ Including multivariate analysis to determine the correlations and
analysisof target variables.
○ To determine if new features can be created, based on the given data.
● Layout binary classification experimentation space (i.e. determine the list
of models you would like to experiment with)
● Using precision-recall curves to determine best threshold
● Publish the performance of all the models on the same hold-out/ test dataset.
● List out the most important drivers of heart disease or attack.
● Using techniques such as oversampling, undersampling to
handleclass-imbalance.
